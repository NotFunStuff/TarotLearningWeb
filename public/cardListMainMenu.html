                <p>Tarot is a deck of 78 cards, each with its own image, symbol, and story. </p>
                <p>
                    The 22 Major Arcana cards represent karmic and spiritual lessons in life. They represent a path to
                    spiritual self-realization and describe the different stages we encounter as we seek greater meaning
                    and
                    understanding. In this way, the Major Arcana cards contain lessons of profound meaning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The 56 Arcana minor cards reflect the challenges we experience every day. These Tarot cards
                    highlight
                    the
                    practical aspects of and can refer to current issues that have a temporary or minor effect in life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the Minor Arcana deck, there are 16 Tarot Court cards, each representing 16 different personality
                    traits that we can choose to express in any situation (character, event, ...) .
                    There are also 40 numbered cards arranged into 4 Suits – Cups, Pentacles, Swords and Wands – each
                    with
                    10 cards, representing different situations we encounter on a daily basis.

                <p>Some people may say that Tarot cards are simply pictures. However, what I have discovered from
                    reading Tarot cards daily over the past time is this:</p>
                <div class="special-text">Tarot is a tool that helps us analyze things in many different ways
                    It is the key to understanding others and understanding yourself.</div>
                <p>Every lesson we come across in life can be found in the 78 Tarot cards. And when we refer to the
                    Tarot cards, we will be shown the exact lessons that we need to learn and master to live a confident
                    life. It is the key to help you get into the subconscious and help us answer questions related to
                    our lives.</p>
